# MasterThesis-JazzNetwork

## Introduction
There are many systems that take the form of networks, i.e. a set of nodes connected to each other by edges.
Among the systems most commonly studied in the literature, we find, among others, the network of hypertext
links on the *World Wide Web*, the network of scientific citation, the network of roads between cities in a country
or the networks related to biology.

This document (*and this code*) aims to answer the following question : **What are the parameters favouring the preferential attachment among jazz
musicians within a collaborative network ?**
