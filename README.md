# MasterThesis-JazzNetwork

## Introduction

There are many systems that take the form of networks, i.e. a set of nodes connected to each other by edges.
Among the systems most commonly studied in the literature, we find, among others, the network of hypertext
links on the World Wide Web, the network of scientific citation, the network of roads between cities in a country
or the networks related to biology.
This document focuses in detail on the network formed by jazz musicians. In this network, each node represents a musician and the links between these nodes indicate whether they played together on an album or at
a concert. These lines will therefore focus on the study of a collaborative network as well as on the construction
of this network and its associated parameters.
For information purposes, this document is the summary of a final thesis that began in 2020 and aims to
answer the following question : **What are the parameters favouring the preferential attachment among jazz
musicians within a collaborative network ?**

## Good luck

## To Do

 - Refactor : move some main function to network class, create utility class
 - Create network for instrument (size of node depend of # musician)
